;; This version of print-step is very similar to our original, but instead of
;; passing a map of info, where we broke out :step and :time and :cars, we pass
;; those elements as individual arguments. Also, I fixed a bug to make sure that
;; even if a car had 0 distance, a line for it would still be printed.

;; This function returns a sequence of randomly-incremented groups of cars.

;; It is an infinite (!) sequence, so we probably need to limit what we print
